# Welcome to My Portfolio Website! 🎨🚀

Welcome to the repository housing my very own portfolio website. This site isn't just a collection of my work; it's a journey. A journey that's seen me grow from a curious learner to a proficient developer. 🌱➡️👩‍💻

## The Journey 🛤️

- **Starting Point**: My initial build of this site was raw HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No frameworks, no shortcuts. Just pure code, reflecting my determination to learn from the ground up. 📖
- **Evolution**: As I delved deeper, I discovered the power of frameworks for code maintainability and stylistic consistency. Enter Bootstrap. A game-changer that allowed me to refocus on creativity rather than compatibility. 🔄
- **Design Philosophy**: Drawing from my experience with eCommerce platforms and content management systems, I carefully planned out my site's design even before coding began. My goal was to create a space that's engaging, reflects my personal journey, and effectively highlights my projects and achievements. Each element is thoughtfully placed to ensure the layout is not just visually appealing but also personable and purpose-driven. 

## Features 💡

- **Responsive Design**: Crafted with Bootstrap, my site is _mostly_ responsive out of the box. Baring in mind, this site will continue to be a WIP, I'm currently at the peak of improving mobile friendliness. 📱💻
- **Personal Touch**: Every section of this site is a window to my personality—bright and minimal by design, it mirrors my creative yet effective approach to problem-solving. it's me, in digital form 😂
- **Showcase Galore**: From projects to certifications, every achievement has its moment in the spotlight. Dive in and explore my journey through code. 🏆📚

## Behind the Scenes 🎬

Building this site was a hands-on learning experience. Every challenge faced and obstacle overcome was a step towards becoming the developer I am becoming. I've documented my learning, sharing insights and breakthroughs, making this repository not just a codebase, but a roadmap for others on a similar journey.
